This was my first attempt at a fullstack application. I am doing a complete remake using React and Node, now that I have a much greater grasp of the technologies.

## Pickup basketball made easy.
**Create or find a game of pickup basketball. Now you can have other people watch you air ball.**
## Creating a game is easy.
**Set some basic rules. List the number of players. Give everyone a few details like when to meet up. Set a location.**

## Or you can find a game.
**Feel like playing ball, but not the host? See if you can't find a game in your area. Search filters coming soon.**
